# Lellarte - My first Laravel website

## Description
A website that showcases my aunt's paintings and creative works.
This is my first time using [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) so ~~it's probably going to end up in a mess~~ It actually didn't! (for the most part)  

You can see it live at [lellarte.ch](http://lellarte.ch/)

It's been a fun project, see ya on the next one üçª
